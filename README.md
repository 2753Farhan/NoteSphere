# Scenario 
Imagine a platform where students and teachers can collaboratively  manage and share study materials. A student uploads class notes, and  the system automatically organizes them, generates quizzes, and  facilitates AI-driven discussions. Teachers have a dedicated portal to  review and validate content, while students can interact with their  peers and the notes to enhance learning.
